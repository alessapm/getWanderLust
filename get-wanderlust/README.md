# getWanderLust 

Welcome to getWanderLust, a truly photo-inspired travel site, allowing you to feed your wanderlust by viewing crave-worthy photos of your desired destinations paired with the destination's top attractions. This project consists of two repositories, the front-end repo is built in React and is available [here](https://github.com/alessapm/getWanderLust) and the back-end is built in Node.js and is available [here](https://github.com/alessapm/getWanderLust-node). The contents of this README will apply to both of these repos, as they comprise one app. To see the deployed site, click [here](https://getwanderlust.herokuapp.com)

## Obstacles 

Building a modal in React was more challenging than I expected. 

## Unsolved Problems 

Getting my modal to pop-up starting with the designated image that was clicked. 

## Future Goals

I would like users to have an already explored list, where they can list a place they have been and provide comments. 

I would like to add priorities to the explore list items, so that the list can be sorted by priority and users can update the priority of each city in their list. 

I would like to be able to click on the tourist attractions and bring up more information.
